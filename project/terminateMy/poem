The stars above are shining bright,
In the calm and peaceful night.
A gentle breeze whispers through the air,
Carrying tales of a love affair.

Moonlight bathes the world in its glow,
Casting shadows that dance and flow.
In the silence, emotions flare,
As the universe weaves a love affair.

Are we but stardust in the vast expanse,
Caught in the cosmic, eternal dance?
Questions linger in the midnight air,
As the poet pens this love affair.
